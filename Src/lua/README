This is Lua 5.3.5, released on 26 Jun 2018.

For installation instructions, license details, and
further information about Lua, see doc/readme.html.

//========================================================================
I have modified this release by patching all #include <> to instead include
via a name defined in rtl_mods.h.  This allows more easily 'shimming'
implementations in that are more appropriate for an embedded environment than
what the standard C library assumes.  The main areas where this must be done
are in stdio.h and stdlib.h for all the FILE* stuff (since embedded usually
has no file system or does via third party library), but also things like
system, exit, and getenv, which have no meaning in embedded.

Additionally:
*  I dropped luac.c, which is a stand-alone executable, anyway
*  I have modified lua.c, which is the 'main' module for the interactive
  interpreter.
  For initial experimentation, I still want this, but I am going to be
  invoking it from a FreeRTOS task, so it doesn't have the same sort of
  main() with arg, argv, etc.
  This probably will be replaced eventually (maybe), but it is useful for
  now while I bring up the rest of the platform.
