This is Lua 5.3.4, released on 12 Jan 2017.

For installation instructions, license details, and
further information about Lua, see doc/readme.html.

//========================================================================
I have modified this release as little as practically as possible for my
embedded needs.
*  I dropped luac.c, which is a stand-alone executable, anyway
*  I have modified lua.c, which is the 'main' module for the interactive
  interpreter.
  For initial experimentation, I still want this, but I am going to be
  invoking it from a FreeRTOS task, so it doesn't have the same sort of
  main() with arg, argv, etc.
  This probably will be replaced eventually (maybe), but it is useful for
  now while I bring up the rest of the platform, especially the newlib
  syscalls adaption and a serial channels for stdin/out/err.
